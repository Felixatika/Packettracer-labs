I configure Network Address Translation(NAT) in all its three types
1. Static NAT - Manually map inside local IP with inside global IP
2. Dynamic NAT - I created a pool of inside global IP and let the NAT map inside local with available outside global addresses automatically
3. PAT or NAT overload - A single inside global IP address is mapped with inside local IP address using the source port Address

   ##NAT is the process which translates IP addresses, can be performed at firewall, router or server.
